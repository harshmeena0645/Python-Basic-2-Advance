✅ Phase 1: Easy (Basic Python) — 20 Questions
These questions cover variables, data types, operators, loops, conditionals, functions, lists, strings, etc.

1. What is the output of the following?
x = 5
y = "5"
print(x + int(y))
Answer: 10
Explanation: int(y) converts the string "5" to integer, so 5 + 5 = 10.

2. Swap two variables in Python without a temporary variable.
a = 10
b = 20
a, b = b, a
print(a, b)
Answer: 20 10
Explanation: Python allows swapping using tuple unpacking.

3. What does this return?
len("Hello World")
Answer: 11
Explanation: len() counts characters, including spaces.

4. What is the output?
print(type([1, 2, 3]))
Answer: <class 'list'>

5. Print even numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)

6. How do you take input from user in Python?
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)

7. What is the output?
print("Python"[-1])
Answer: 'n'
Explanation: Negative indexing gives the last character.

8. Write a function to return square of a number.
def square(n):
    return n * n
print(square(4))  # Output: 16

9. What is a list in Python? Give an example.
Answer: A list is an ordered, mutable collection of items.
Example: my_list = [1, 2, "apple"]

10. How do you add an element to a list?
my_list = [1, 2]
my_list.append(3)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

11. Write code to check if a number is positive, negative or zero.
n = int(input())
if n > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif n < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Zero")

12. How to reverse a string in Python?
s = "hello"
print(s[::-1])  # Output: 'olleh'

13. What is the output?
print(2 ** 3)
Answer: 8
Explanation: ** is the exponent operator.

14. Write code to find factorial using loop.
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result

15. How to get a sublist from index 1 to 3?
lst = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(lst[1:4])  # Output: [20, 30, 40]

16. What is the output?
x = None
print(type(x))
Answer: <class 'NoneType'>

17. How to check type of a variable?
a = 10
print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'int'>
18. Difference between = and ==?
= is assignment
== is comparison

19. Write a Python program to check if a number is even.
num = int(input())
if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")

20. What will this print?
print("a" * 5)
Answer: 'aaaaa'
Explanation: String repetition using *
